# TransArt: A Multimodal Application for Vernacular Language Translation and Image Synthesis

## Project Overview

TransArt is a web-based application designed to translate text from Tamil to English and then generate corresponding images based on the translated text. This project showcases the seamless integration of neural language translation with AI-powered text-to-image generation, offering users a multimodal experience that enhances learning, creativity, and content generation.

## Key Features

**Tamil to English Translation:**

    Converts Tamil text into English using neural machine translation.
    
**Text-to-Image Generation:** 
    
    Generates visual content based on the translated English text using models like Stable Diffusion.
    
**Creative Text Generation:** 

    Option to produce creative English text based on the translation, enriching multimedia offerings.
    
## Use Cases

**Educational Tools:**

    Aids students and educators by converting Tamil descriptions into visual English content for better understanding.
    
**Creative Content Generation:** 
    
    Streamlines the creation of visual content from Tamil descriptions for digital marketing, presentations, and more.

## Technologies Used

**Hugging Face Models:**

      For translation (e.g., Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ta-en) and image generation (e.g., CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4).
      
**Streamlit/Gradio:**

    For building the user interface and handling interactions.
    
**Python:**

    For developing the application, following PEP 8 coding standards.
    
## Deliverables

1.Source code for the full application.

2.Deployment guide for setting up models and hosting the application on Hugging Face Spaces or AWS.

3.User manual for interacting with the app.

4.Performance analysis evaluating functionality, scalability, and user engagement.
